    <h2>What can you do?</h2> 
    <br>
    <li>On a local level you can make ocean-friendly choices when buying food or product derived from the ocean, and only consume what we need.</li>
    <li>Reduce your carbon footprint, one of the the factors contributing to the rising sea levels, this can be done by taking public transport or unplugging electronics saveing energy. </li>
    <li>Eliminate youre use of plastic as much as possible, and go out and clean up trash, preventing it from ending up in the ocean.</li>

   <h2>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</h2> 
    <br>
    <p>Oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well-being and social and economic development worldwide. They are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. Oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. They also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. In fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated USDâ€¯28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. However, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. 
    <br>Information about targets and progress can be found on the official SDG website. <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg14">Learn more about SDG14 here.</a></p>
