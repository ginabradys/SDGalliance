   <h2>Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.</h2> 
    <br>
    <p>Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is the key to escaping poverty. Education is also essential to achieving many of the Sustanable Development Goals.
    <br>
    Over 265 million children are currently out of school and 22% of them are of primary school age. Additionally, even the children who are attending schools are lacking basic skills in reading and math. In the past decade, major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrollment rates in schools particularly for women and girls. The reasons for lack of quality education are due to lack of adequately trained teachers, poor conditions of schools and equity issues related to opportunities provided to rural children. For quality education to be provided to the children of impoverished families, investment is needed in educational scholarships, teacher training workshops, school building and improvement of water and electricity access to schools.
    <br>Information about targets and progress can be found on the official SDG website. <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4">Learn more about SDG4 here.</a></p>
