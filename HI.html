    <h4>DESCRIPTION OF  MY APPLICATION TASK </h4>

    <div class="headline">
    <h1>THE ASSIGMENT </h1>
    <p>Describe how you, in your own way and by using your circle of control and influence — can make a positive impact and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

    <h1>CHOICE OF SDG GOAL </h1>
    <p><b>I’ve chosen goal number 17</b> It is about creating sustainable development through global partnerships. Goal number 17 argue the fact that sustainable development is depending on partnerships and collaboration cross borders, between governments, private sector and also the civil society. For me number 17 is a call for help and action to all human beings, - meaning we’re all in this mess together and it’s our duty to try fix the damages already done and prepare for a better future for generations to come. 
<br><br>
    Solving the SDG goals are a complicated matter, and it’s not done overnight. Hence, during the last three weeks we’ve experienced the brutal consequences that the COVID19 virus has caused - we’ve learned how fast it is possible for an entire planet to make rapid changes, if it’s critical. Nothing positive said about the Corona virus, but still it gives me hope that together we’re able to make a positive movement where it’s possible to take initiative on a individual and collaborative level.

    <h1>PROBLEM </h1>
    <p>Whilst governments, world leaders, major organisations are searching for new solutions on how to facilitate for a better future, people on an individual level is still insecure on how to contribute. A common issue is peoples lack of knowledge about their possibilities for contribute, and the information varies from country to country. This said, there’s a lot of information out there, we just have to spread it in an easy and understandable way between countries and boarders. 
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="headline">
    <h1>SOLUTION </h1>
    <p>From the age of 16 years old, I went to an international boarding school in the UK. This means that I’ve lived together with people at my same age from almost every corners of the world. When getting to know my classmates, and later friends, I took notice of how everyone was invested in the global issues, however our background made us look different on which one of the SDGs was the most important. I would believe this is based on what issues their home country are faceing. As a result each one of us had different insights and experiences of the problems. Which again lead to us having a wide range of knowledge regarding actions to be made.
<br><br>
    Therefore I figured it was my global network I wanted to utilise as my circle of influence.Together we could create an alliance where we shared concrete sustainable actions with each other. Actions that we’ve experienced, tried or learned about in our local surroundings. By addressing examples and hopefully also key learnings and results we could share knowledge cross boarders, communities and our inner circle of influence.  
<br><br>
    Based on the theory that every human can connect through six layers of acquaintances, I truly believe that I and my inner circle together can share knowledge and actions that makes our planet a better place.

    <h1>FINAL PRODUCT</h1>
    <p>I’ve created a concept which I decided to brand SDG Alliance. The word alliance is described  as a relationship among people, groups or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out among them (source: Wikipedia). It has the purpose of uniting individuals to collacorate and developing the smaller actions we can take.
<br><br>
    To be able to bring together my international network and encourage them to join me on this mission, I have created a informative webpage that explains the purpose of SDG Alliance and how we together can make a change. To connect with members of the Alliance my plan is to use Facebook as a connecting platform. Here we can share actions and knowledge, as well as continuously recruit new members to our alliance. As a member of the SDG Alliance you automatically become a Spire, but those who contribute actively gets the acknowledgement of becoming an Ambassador of one or several SDG goals where they specifically have made a difference.
<br><br>
    Our mission is to act as role models towards people around us, inspiring and encuraging to contribute to take action and make a change.
