         <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>UN's Sustainable Development Goals address the lagest issues of the world and ask for drastic measures. In the larger perspective our contributions as a small individuals may seem insignificant. With the belief that we are stronger together, we have created a meeting point for people with the same aspirations, where we can collaborate, motivate and inspire each other. Starting by doing the smaller actions and changes in our lives, we can inspire others to do the same and thereby create a ripple effect.</p>

      <h2>Inform</h2>
      <p>Lack of knowledge about the various issues and their magnitude is an issue by itself. Same goes for the lack of knowledge about what we can do as individuals to contribute, as the consequences might not directly affect us. These are the main reasons behind why people choose not to engage in the global issues. 
      Through our Alliances we want to spread the word, and make knowledge and information about the SDGs, and how we as a indivuduals can engage, easier accessable.</p>

      <h2>Encourage</h2>
      <p>Through the SDG Alliance we want to gather inspiring people who wish to encourage more people around them to take part in the problem solving. We have our Spires who work to share their engagement and smaller actions in their communities. Further we have our Ambassadors who have gained more responsbility, working to activate the bigger movements. </p>
