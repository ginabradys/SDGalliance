    <h1>ZERO WASTE WEEK</h1>

<div class="content">
    <h2>The zero waste week is a challenge where we challenge you to not trash anything over the course of 7 days. </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Living a fully zero waste lifestyle is a life change that is equal to impossible to make happen overnight. It requires baby steps over a longer time period, mabye up to one or two years, slowly exchangeing your stuff into zero waste products, or researching how to reuse your stuff, either yourself or giving it away for a new purpose. Therefore, <b>this challenge is more about not bringing anything new into your home that will turn into waste </b> - because we all have those products we can´t suddenly stop using.
    <br><br>
    <b> What do we want to get out of this?</b> By trying toget you to do a relatively drastic change for a week, we want you to be able in retrospect be inspired to build some new habits or do some smaller changes in your life. Like, is there something you had to cut out, that you realized you actually don´t need? Or is there a hack or a zero waste product to you could consider trying to continue using?  Every little change matters.
    <br><br>
    <b>Please share this challange and dare someone you think should live a bit more sustainable. #zerowasteweek</b>
